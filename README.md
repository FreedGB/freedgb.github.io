# My Portfolio website
I use this README to document my progress through the project.

## Features
- [ ] Hi, my name is ..., I'm a robotics engineer (typing animation)
- [x] Projects list
- [x] A doc for each project
- [ ] My education
- [x] Home, About, Projects pages
- [ ] RPG system (stats, xp, difficulty D C B A S, etc.)
- [ ] Show numbers of projects done

## Early stage

- Tool chosen : I decided to use Hugo, as I won't have to focus HTML, CSS, JS, but more on the main content using Markdown files.
- Template : [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page). Beautiful and highly customizable.
- Tutorial series : [Hugo - Static Site Generator by Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3)

## Execution
I've installed Hugo and Blowfish, then configured the theme by in the [documentation](https://blowfish.page/docs/).
NB: Make sure the versions of Hugo and Blowfish are compatible.

Since the basic homepage options doesn't satisfy me, I've decided to make a custom one, based on some references, and by following again the documentation.

Custom files created :
- `DMSans.ttf` : The font
- `article-link/simple.html` : Article card
- `custom.html` and `custom.css` : Homepage, inspired by the `profile layout`
- `recent-articles/main.html` : Recent project list
