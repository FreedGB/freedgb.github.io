## Early stage

- Tool chosen : I decided to use Hugo, as I won't have to focus HTML, CSS, JS, but more on the main content using Markdown files.
- Template : [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page). Beautiful and highly customizable.
- Tutorial series : [Hugo - Static Site Generator by Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3)

## Execution
I've installed Hugo and Blowfish, then configured the theme by in the [documentation](https://blowfish.page/docs/).

Since the basic homepage options doesn't satisfy me, I've decided to make a custom one, based on some references, and by following again the documentation. So I created custom `html`, `css` files, and used a custom font named `DM Sans` I've found in my references.
